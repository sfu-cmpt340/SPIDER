# Introduction ‚úèÔ∏è
Using this [dataset](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/andrewmvd/fetal-health-classification/data), which has cardiotocography (CTG) biosignals for 2126 fetuses, each with 22 features and a label: Normal, Suspect, and Pathological.
Our goal is to create a robust model which can predict fetal health from this data.
We plan to train and test several classification models (such as linear, svm, supervised learning ML) to predict/classify the health of the fetus, and identify which model is most effective.

## 4. Guidance

- Use [git](https://git-scm.com/book/en/v2)
    - Do NOT use history re-editing (rebase)
    - Commit messages should be informative:
        - No: 'this should fix it', 'bump' commit messages
        - Yes: 'Resolve invalid API call in updating X'
    - Do NOT include IDE folders (.idea), or hidden files. Update your .gitignore where needed.
    - Do NOT use the repository to upload data
- Use [VSCode](https://code.visualstudio.com/) or a similarly powerful IDE
- Use [Copilot for free](https://dev.to/twizelissa/how-to-enable-github-copilot-for-free-as-student-4kal)
- Sign up for [GitHub Education](https://education.github.com/)
